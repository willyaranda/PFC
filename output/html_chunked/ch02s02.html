Circuit domain states</h2></div></div></div><p>
      In the 3GPP TS 25.331 specification, we can query all the circuit domain
      statues of the RRC Layer (Radio Resource Control).
    </p><p>
      In order to simplify, we only list the third generation (3G) states:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          Cell_DCH (Dedicated Channel)
          <p>
            When the handset is in this state is because it has a dedicated
            channel on the mobile network.
          </p><p>
            Normally the network sets a handsent into this state when it's
            transmitting a big amount of data.
          </p><p>
            The inactivity time of this state is really short, known as T1 timer
            it should vary between 5 and 20 seconds. If T1 is fired, the handset
            will be changed to the Cell_FACH state.
          </p></li><li class="listitem">
          Cell_FACH
          <p>
            In this state the handset is connected to the mobile network using
            a shared channel with other handsets.
          </p><p>
            Normally, this state is assigned by the network when the handset is
            transmitting a small amount of data.
            So it's common to use it when sending keep-alive packages.
          </p><p>
            The inactivity time of this state is a little longer (30 seconds) and
            is konwn as T2 timer. When T2 timer is shotted, the handset will be
            moved to Cell_PCH or URA_PCH (depending on the type of network)
          </p></li><li class="listitem">
          Cell_PCH or URA_PCH (PCH: Paging Channel) (URA: UTRAN Registration Area)
          <p>
            In this state the handset is not able to send any data except
            signalling information in order to be able to localize the handset
            inside the celullar network.
          </p><p>
            In both states, the RRC connection is established and open, but it's
            rarely used.
          </p><p>
            In this state, the handset informs the network every time the device
            change from one sector to another so the network is able to known
            exactly the BTS which is offering service to the device.
          </p><p>
            The T3 timer defines the maximum time to be in a PCH state. This timer
            is longer than T1 and T2 and depends on each carrier. When it's fired
            the handset is moved to IDLE mode so if new data transmission is needed
            the handset will need near 2 seconds to restablish the channel and a
            lot of signalling messages.
          </p></li><li class="listitem">
          RRC_IDLE
          <p>
            This is the most economical state since the handset radio is practically
            stopped.
          </p><p>
            In this state, the radio is only listening to radio messages quering
            the handset to "Wake Up" (paging messages).
          </p><p>
            Also, the handset modem is listening the cell data so each time it
            detects that the user changed from one LAC (Localization Area Code -
            Group of multiple BTS) to another, the handset will change to the
            PCH state in order to inform the network.
          </p><p>
            So when a handset is in this state, it can be Waked Up to a more
            active state and also the network knowns the LAC where the handset
            is moving, so if the network needs to inform the handset it should
            send a broadcast paging message through all the LAC BTS in order to
            locate the handset.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
